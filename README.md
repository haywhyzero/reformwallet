# Reform Wallet

**Your Personal Finance & Tax Companion**

Welcome to **Reform Wallet**! I built this application to help Nigerians navigate the complexities of personal finance and the upcoming **2026 Tax Reform**.

Managing money can be tough, and understanding new tax laws is even tougher. Reform Wallet is designed to simplify this process. It's not just an expense tracker; it's a tool to give you clarity on your financial standing and your estimated tax obligations under the new progressive tax brackets.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Smart Expense Tracking:** Easily log your daily income and expenses to keep a close eye on your cash flow.
*   **Tax Calculator (2026 Reform):** Confused about the new tax policy? The built-in calculator estimates your tax liability based on the 2026 guidelines, helping you plan ahead.
*   **Visual Analytics:** View your financial habits with beautiful, easy-to-read charts and statistics.
*   **Privacy First:** Your financial data is yours alone. Reform Wallet is a **local-first** application, meaning your data is stored securely on your device and is not transmitted to external servers.
*   **Reminders:** Set monthly local notifications so you never forget to log your transactions.
*   **Dark Mode:** Easy on the eyes for late-night budgeting.
